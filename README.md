# ISawedThisPlayerInHalf
Your player... is ca- oh my god, his torso is flying!

This mod splits apart the player, freeing the torso from the legs.

  
## How to Use
These chat commands allow you to control offsets in-game.

* Help: **::offsets help**
* Set offsets: **::offsets set \<x> \<y> \<z>**
* Reset offsets: **::offsets reset**
* Print out offsets: **::offsets get**

::ofs can be used in place of ::offsets.


## Multiplayer
The mod must also be on the server for multiplayer-compatibility.

I would **_not_** recommend using this on a server that does not have the mod.
